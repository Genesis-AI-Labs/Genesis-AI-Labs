Today we're announcing Genesis AI Labs, a research lab focused on developing advanced AI agents, simulations, and reinforcement learning environments that will enable breakthrough discoveries in artificial intelligence and accelerate progress toward superintelligence.

We will achieve this by creating sophisticated research environments and computational frameworks that capture the full scope of what researchers need to do their work. This includes building advanced geometric deep learning systems, developing physics-informed AI models, and creating environments for training intelligent agents that can adapt and learn in complex scenarios.

We're betting that the lion's share of value from AI will come from automating complex research tasks rather than from "incremental improvements in existing systems". Currently, AI models have serious shortcomings that render most of this enormous potential out of reach. They struggle with long-term reasoning, lack robust understanding of geometric structures, and can't effectively combine multiple modalities of information without losing critical context.

To overcome these limitations, Genesis AI Labs will produce the research and computational frameworks necessary for comprehensively advancing AI capabilities. Our research environments will act as practical testbeds for real-world AI scenarios, enabling agents to learn sophisticated reasoning through advanced reinforcement learning and geometric deep learning approaches.

The potential impact here is transformative: AI research in India is rapidly growing, with significant investment in AI infrastructure and talent development. For the entire research community, the opportunities are even greater, with global AI research funding reaching unprecedented levels.

The exponential growth in AI capabilities likely to result from breakthrough research could generate vast improvements in scientific discovery, technological innovation, and our understanding of intelligence itself. Our vision is to realize this potential as quickly and safely as possible.
