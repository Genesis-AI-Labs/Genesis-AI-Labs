          Today we're announcing Genesis AI Labs, a research lab focused on developing advanced AI agents, 
          simulations, and reinforcement learning environments that will enable breakthrough discoveries in 
          artificial intelligence and accelerate progress toward superintelligence.
        </p>

        <p className="text-base leading-relaxed text-black">
          We will achieve this by creating sophisticated research environments and computational frameworks 
          that capture the full scope of what researchers need to do their work. This includes building 
          advanced geometric deep learning systems, developing physics-informed AI models, and creating 
          environments for training intelligent agents that can adapt and learn in complex scenarios.
        </p>

        <p className="text-base leading-relaxed text-black">
          We're betting that the lion's share of value from AI will come from <a href="#" className="underline hover:no-underline">automating complex research tasks</a> 
          rather than from "incremental improvements in existing systems". Currently, AI models have serious 
          shortcomings that render most of this enormous potential out of reach. They struggle with long-term 
          reasoning, lack robust understanding of geometric structures, and can't effectively combine multiple 
          modalities of information without losing critical context.
        </p>

        <p className="text-base leading-relaxed text-black">
          To overcome these limitations, Genesis AI Labs will produce the research and computational frameworks 
          necessary for comprehensively advancing AI capabilities. Our research environments will act as 
          practical testbeds for real-world AI scenarios, enabling agents to learn sophisticated reasoning 
          through advanced reinforcement learning and geometric deep learning approaches.
        </p>

        <p className="text-base leading-relaxed text-black">
          The potential impact here is transformative: AI research in India is rapidly growing, with 
          significant investment in <a href="#" className="underline hover:no-underline">AI infrastructure and talent development</a>. 
          For the entire research community, the opportunities are even greater, with global AI research 
          funding reaching unprecedented levels.
        </p>

        <p className="text-base leading-relaxed text-black">
          The <a href="#" className="underline hover:no-underline">exponential growth in AI capabilities</a> likely 
          to result from breakthrough research could generate vast improvements in scientific discovery, 
          technological innovation, and our understanding of intelligence itself. Our vision is to realize 
          this potential as quickly and safely as possible.
