# [Genesis AI Labs](https://www.genesisai.in/)

Welcome to Genesis AI Labs, a research group which focuses on making impact on real world problems related to use of Modern Machine learning Practices in broad prespective areas like Computer Vision, Graph Networks, Cyber Security and Healthcare.

We produce research and projects to scale-up the implementation of research in the real world.

Genesis AI Labs is currently working in association with Manipal University Jaipur, under supervision of Dr Rajveer Singh Shekhawat who is Director of School of Computing and IT.

Genesis AI Labs Encourages and Invite Researchers working in the same fields across the world, to work with us and produce high impactful research.

Following Research Pods are present to showcase the fields in which work has been done or currently going on

Recent advancements in the field of AI ignites the motivation for the research in the respective areas.

Few of the currently focused research fields in **Genesis AI Labs** are listed below:

- [Geometric Deep Learning and Graph Machine Learning](https://www.genesisai.in/research-pods/geometric-deep-learning-and-graph-machine-learning)
